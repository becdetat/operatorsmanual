# Rebecca's Operator's Manual


## In your life/work, what do you look like on your best day? (What are the mindsets, attitudes, and behaviors that characterize you when you’re at your best?)
- I’m not tired
- I’m excited to start the day
- I have a relatively clean slate to work from, most of yesterday’s tasks are done
- I’m able to coherently contribute to calls that I’m involved in
- I’m not overwhelmed by things that happen during the day, especially things that are out of my control or that I’ve delegated to someone else (avoiding micromanagement)
- I’m not anxious or stressed
- I manage to finish my day with most of my tasks done and at a reasonable time

## How would you describe your personality or working style?
- I’m naturally very introverted, however I try to flip that whenever I’m on a call with someone
- This can be mentally draining, so I try to have a circuit breaker between calls (make a coffee, have some fruit, walk around the house)
- Calls make up a big portion of my week, and I prefer morning calls, leaving the afternoon for other work activities
- I try to start around 7-8am and finish around 4-5pm. Some mornings I might start even earlier but I always try to stick to around 8 hours of work a day.
- There is potential for a half hour nap depending on the day, I use the break to problem solve if I find myself staring at the screen trying to figure out a seemingly intractable problem.

## When things start to feel stressful, I look like this:
- When things get stressful for the team:
  - I try to get more involved in high-level decisions
  - I make efforts to reduce distractions and run interference for the rest of the team
  - I allow the other team members to solve problems on their own as they probably have a much better perspective than me
  - I also try to make sure I understand the problem so that I can help make sure it doesn’t  happen again in the future
- When I personally get stressed I tend to go silent and internalise things. It’s very easy to slip into imposter syndrome mode.

## When things start to feel stressful, I need this:
- A circuit breaker - getting away from the computer for a while:
  - Have lunch
  - Go for a walk
  - I might have an hour nap, and spend the first 30 minutes thinking about the problem and potential solutions while physically relaxing. Most of the time I work out the solution during a nap.
- Changing focus works well also
- Sometimes it becomes obvious physically that I am highly stressed or agitated. I appreciate understanding and being gently asked if I’m ok, it gives me a push to ask my support network for additional help.

## What can people do to make you feel appreciated and supported in your work?
- Letting me know when something I have influenced is working well or has improved their working life

## What qualities do you particularly value in people who work with you?
- Honesty
- Inclusiveness
- Willingness to learn and improve

## How do you like to give feedback?
- Verbally but with a written summary to keep things clear

## How do you like to get feedback?
- Verbally but with a written summary to keep things clear

## Outside of work, what is most important to you?
- My kidlette and my family
- Also listening to music
- Also badly playing musical instruments

## What is most misunderstood about you, if anything, that you would like to clarify?
- People assume that I’m outgoing and funny because of how I act on the internet, but in person I’m very shy and socially awkward

## What else should people know about you or how you work?
- I like to have processes around how I work
  - I have a list of four areas that I read to start tackling the day: Slack, emails, P2s, GitHub
  - I have a Trello board of items to think about, which I cycle through during the day when I’m not doing other things
- I tried using the Pomodoro Technique a few years ago and liked it but didn’t end up sticking with it, I don’t know why
- The first ten years of my programming career I was the only programmer (and IT manager) in a financial planning firm, so I basically taught myself everything I needed to know from junior programmer up to senior programmer. Including all the embarrassing mistakes young people make in their jobs.
- I then worked for almost five years at a consultancy, I would recommend this to any senior programmer for at least a couple of years because the different perspectives you see from month to month (not just programming but leadership skills if you’re interested in it) are very eye opening, largely around what not to do and how to understand and correctly use your influence as a consultant.
